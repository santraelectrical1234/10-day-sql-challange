/*Now, we want to find out the average payment amount received from customers who are currently active subscribers and have renewed their 
subscription during the month of July 2023. Since customers worldwide pay in their local currencies, we need to convert the payment
amounts to USD (United States Dollars) for analysis.

For instance, if a customer is from Canada and paid in Canadian Dollars (CAD), we will convert their payment amount to USD using the exchange rate of 1 CAD = 1.25 USD. Similarly, for customers from the UK paying in British Pounds (GBP), we will convert their payment amount to USD using the exchange rate of 1 GBP = 0.8 USD, and so on for other currencies. The exchange rates are as follows:
1 EUR (Euro) = 0.9 USD (USD to EUR)
1 JPY (Japanese Yen) = 110.0 USD (USD to JPY)
1 INR (Indian Rupee) = 81.0 USD (USD to INR)

The final output will show the customer_id and their average payment amount in both USD and the customer's local currency, 
along with the exchange rate used for the conversion. If a customer's local currency is USD, the average payment amount in their
currency will be the same as the average payment in USD, and the exchange rate will be 1.0.*/
