/*In an E-commerce store, we have sales data recorded in the "sales" table, containing information about cashier ids, department names, and discounts given by the cashier.

Instructions:
Import the data from the "sales.csv" file into MySql enviornment.

Write an SQL query to display the cashier_id along with the total discount amount issued by each cashier, then add the top department name with the highest refund given
 by each cashier, then add the total amount of discount given by the each cashier in the top department and how many times the cashier gives the discount 
 in that top department.

At the end, it'll show the cashier_id, total_discount_amount, top_department_name, top_department_total_discount, and top_department_total_count.*/
