# Throughout the 10 days, I tackled a series of progressively challenging SQL tasks, refining my skills and gaining hands-on experience. Each day was a step forward in mastering SQL, and I'm proud to have persevered through the entire journey. 

# These hands-on experiences have not only broadened my understanding but also equipped me with versatile concepts for real-world SQL challenges.

## SQL Concepts Explored:

- Aggregate functions 
- Joins
- Sub-queries
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window functions
- Data importation 
- Text functions 
- Efficient handling of large datasets

## Additionally, I've put together a presentation summarizing my journey through this challenge.
